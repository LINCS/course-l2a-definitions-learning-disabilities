        <content>&lt;h1 class="Subhead"&gt;LD are not due to other conditions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s move on to consensus statement #5. “&lt;b&gt;LD may occur in combination with other disabling conditions, but they are not due to other conditions&lt;/b&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>LD are not caused by “exclusionary” factors</title>
        <content>&lt;h1 class="Subhead"&gt;LD are not caused by “exclusionary” factors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learners may experience LD in combination with other disabilities. This is known as comorbidity or co-occurrence. For example, an individual may have both LD and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), or an adult may have LD and mental health issues, such as depression. An individual may have learning disabilities and face socioeconomic disadvantages or may have limited experience with academic English. Although LD often exist in combination with other challenges, LD cannot be caused by these factors, known as “exclusionary” factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vision and hearing assessments help rule out sensory issues as the cause of LD</title>
        <content>&lt;h1 class="Subhead"&gt;Vision and hearing assessments help rule out sensory issues as the cause of LD&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when we think someone may have LD, we first make sure the individual receives vision and hearing assessments to rule out those sensory issues as the cause of the learning deficits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mental illness may be the cause of learning deficits</title>
        <content>&lt;h1 class="Subhead"&gt;Mental illness may be the cause of learning deficits&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the case for individuals with emotional problems who struggle in school because of their mental health needs. These individuals may have learning deficits, but the cause is mental illness, not a learning disability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <content>&lt;h1 class="Subhead"&gt;Chaotic school experiences may be the cause of learning deficits&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some individuals have had chaotic school experiences. Some young adults may exhibit learning deficits based on not attending school, attending low-performing schools or being in a series of programs and services that have not been able to meet their learning and social needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Distinguishing causation from co-occurrence</title>
        <content>&lt;h1 class="Subhead"&gt;Distinguishing causation from co-occurrence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue is that current identification procedures cannot completely distinguish &lt;b&gt;causation&lt;/b&gt; from &lt;b&gt;co-occurrence&lt;/b&gt;. This creates a situation where individuals may be erroneously included or excluded from LD identification on the basis of co-occurring conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation may be further complicated. Individuals who may be struggling with learning because of many of these exclusionary conditions &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; also have similar characteristics to individuals with LD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a person who has lived in poverty with little chance to read at home and poor reading instruction may present the same reading needs as an individual whose reading challenges are caused by LD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
